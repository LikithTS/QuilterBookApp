ðŸ“š BookApp

BookApp is a modern Android application built with Kotlin, following MVVM and Clean Architecture principles.
It fetches book data from an open-source API and displays it in a responsive list that adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

*** Features ***

ðŸ”¹ Multi-Module Architecture â€” clear separation between presentation, domain, and data layers.

ðŸ”¹ Clean Architecture â€” easy to test, scale, and maintain.

ðŸ”¹ MVVM Pattern â€” lifecycle-aware ViewModels with reactive state using Kotlin Flows.

ðŸ”¹ Adaptive UI â€” layouts automatically adjust for portrait, landscape, tablet, and desktop screens.

ðŸ”¹ Error Handling â€” robust success and failure handling with meaningful UI feedback.

ðŸ”¹ Koin - Using koin for dependency injection to make app more towards KMP.

ðŸ”¹ Kotlin Multiplatform Ready â€” (optional) modular structure allows easy extension to other platforms.


*** Project Structure ***
BookApp/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/               # Application module (entry point)
â”œâ”€â”€ presentation/      # UI layer (Compose UI, ViewModels)
â”œâ”€â”€ domain/            # Business logic (Repository Signature)
â”œâ”€â”€ data/              # Repository + data sources (API)
â””â”€â”€ build.gradle(.kts) # Root Gradle config


*** Improvements ***

ðŸ”¹API doesn't support pagination. Need to update api response format to support pagination.

ðŸ”¹Add pagination inside the app when displaying list view. 

ðŸ”¹Creating a custom pagination class to support all format of api response. 

ðŸ”¹Supporting light and dark theme.

ðŸ”¹Moving from retrofit to OkHttp to support KMP in future.

ðŸ”¹Creating a build-logic project to support build.gradle of different module in one place.

ðŸ”¹User is hardcode in viewmodel. This can be passed to viewmodel in later stages.
